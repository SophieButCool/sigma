[GAME] is a single-player level based platformer, and that's about all the information there is.

I guess I'll update this as I go. This game maybe wont be released, since it's just a passion project that I'm only working on for fun. Then again who knows? I've heard zun doesn't care if other people make money off of touhou fan games, maybe if I do finish it I'll put it on steam. Probably like 10 dollars at most, probably 5.

How about some Concept art?
